# Application Onboarding

Example of how complete end-to-end CI/CD processes can be implemented with Electric Flow for new and existing software projects.

2. Edit dslDir to match where the "onboarding" directory is located
3. Login as Admin (ectool login admin)
4. Run the DSL code (ectool evalDsl --dslFile "Onboard new application flow.groovy")
5. From Electric Flow UI logged in as admin, navigate to the project "Application Onboarding" and run "Onboard new application flow" and modify the parameters as desired
6. Navigate to the CI Dashboard
7. Run the CI Configuration <Your app name><Your app name>
8. Once the procedure is completed, navigate to the pipeline from the tool tip over the green square job icon
